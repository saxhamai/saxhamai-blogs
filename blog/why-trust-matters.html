  <h1>Why Digital Trust Matters for Indian Businesses</h1>

  <p>
    Most Indian businesses don’t fail because of bad products.
    They fail because customers don’t trust what they see online.
  </p>

  <p>
    A mismatched business name, incomplete Google Maps listing, outdated website —
    these small things silently break trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Trust Is Built Before the First Call</h2>

  <p>
    Before a customer calls you, visits your shop, or sends a WhatsApp message,
    they already judge your business digitally.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is the business name consistent?</li>
    <li>Does Google Maps look genuine?</li>
    <li>Is the website clear or confusing?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digital Trust Is Not Branding Hype</h2>

  <p>
    Digital trust is not logos, reels, or marketing tricks.
    It is clarity, consistency, and correctness.
  </p>

  <p>
    When basics are right, growth becomes easier.
    When basics are broken, ads only waste money.
